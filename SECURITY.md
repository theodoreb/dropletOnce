# Security Policy

This project is covered by the Drupal security advisory process, which is
facilitated by the Drupal Security Team. To report a security vulnerability,
follow the process described at the following URL:

https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/issues/issue-procedures-and-etiquette/reporting-a-security-issue

Do not disclose the nature of the vulnerability in public. The Drupal Security
Team will publish an advisory and issue a CVE once a fix is available.
